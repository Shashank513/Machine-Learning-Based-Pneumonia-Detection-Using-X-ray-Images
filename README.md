Developed a machine learning system for pneumonia detection using X-ray images, capable of distinguishing between bacterial and viral pneumonia. The project utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) integrated with Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) to handle varying image scales and aspect ratios effectively. The workflow involved collecting and preprocessing a large dataset of labeled X-ray images, applying data augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness. The CNN model was designed and trained to classify pneumonia types, leveraging SPP for improved spatial feature extraction. Advanced training techniques and hyperparameter optimization were employed to maximize accuracy and generalization. The resulting model demonstrated high accuracy in detecting and differentiating pneumonia types, offering a valuable tool for medical diagnostics. Technologies used included Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV. This project contributes to the field of medical imaging and machine learning, providing an efficient solution for early and accurate pneumonia diagnosis.
